     SWBGS is the Grammer School I attended from Yeaer 7 through to year 13 where I studied British and American Politics, Businessand and English Literature in addition to an EPQ pertaining to enviromental and sustainable practices relating to the fashion industry.
     <p><strong>Hoshuko (Japanese International School) </strong><br>
     Whilst I grew up in the UK outside of London, I attended Hoshuko, an international school for Japanese nationals which on Saturday teaches British nationals Japanese. 
        This allowed me excellent perspective on a multicultrual orgnaisation and has made me more open minded throughout my entire life. Through this, I was able to aquire an 9 in Japanese GCSE in addition to my other GCSEs.
